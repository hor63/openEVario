	* src/GliderVarioStatus.h (GliderVarioStatus):
		Refactored ground speed and wind to cartesian North and East components instead of speed and direction.
		Way easier to handle in the transition matrix :)     
	* src/GliderVarioTransitionMatrix.cpp (GliderVarioTransitionMatrix::calcTransitionMatrix): 
		Completed the transition matrix. TODO: Careful code review, and tests. 
	* src/openEVario.cpp (main): 
		10 fold number of FastMath::FastSin() runs for performance test.
		Changed angles in rotation matrix test.
