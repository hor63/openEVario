	* src/GliderVarioStatus.cpp (GliderVarioStatus::GliderVarioStatus):
		Constructor must set the matrix statusVector to 0.
	* src/GliderVarioTransitionMatrix.cpp 	(GliderVarioTransitionMatrix::calcTransitionMatrix): 
		Cleanup.
		Latitude and Longitude length is not in meters. Length in meters is considered.
		Gyro bias must be subtracted.
		Thermal speed is difference between absolute vertical speed and sink rate relative to the air.
	* src/GliderVarioTransitionMatrix.h (GliderVarioTransitionMatrix):
		Constructor must use setZero(), not zero() to set the matrix itself to zero. 
	* src/openEVario.cpp (main):
		First tests added for transition matrix. 
	* src/RotationMatrix.h 
		Added getters for the Yaw, Pitch and Roll members.
		Setters are explicitly inline.

	* src/GliderVarioStatus.h (GliderVarioStatus):
		Refactored ground speed and wind to cartesian North and East components instead of speed and direction.
		Way easier to handle in the transition matrix :)     
	* src/GliderVarioTransitionMatrix.cpp (GliderVarioTransitionMatrix::calcTransitionMatrix): 
		Completed the transition matrix. TODO: Careful code review, and tests. 
	* src/openEVario.cpp (main): 
		10 fold number of FastMath::FastSin() runs for performance test.
		Changed angles in rotation matrix test.
