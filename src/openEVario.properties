#-----------------------------------------
# I/O-Ports. ("port" in the following)
#-----------------------------------------
# Ports are defined in the structure "IOPorts".
# There is one entry per port. Each port is a structure.
# The fields in a port structure differ, based on the port type.
# Common fields for all or at least most port types: 
#   type: Mandatory; port types are either built-in, or additional ones from external driver libs.
#   device: This is the name of the device in the system like '/dev/ttyS0' or
#     'COM8' or '\\.\COM8' (Windows) (Note that '\' characters must be masked, in this case results in '\\\\.\\COM8'!)
#     if the parameter is omitted the port name is assumed to be the device name.
#     Some port types (like network connections) do not use the device field.
#	blocking: yes/no on/off true/false (default yes). If the property is used depends on the port type.
#
# The built-in port types are described here.
# Built-in drivers are: serial, TCPClient, UDP, I2C
# Description of additional parameters for each driver type. Parameters not marked as mandatory are optional:
#
# type = serial # UART or virtual serial ports.
#	device: (mandatory) See above.
#	baud: Flow rate. Supported are: 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, default: keep the current setting.
#		MS-Dos MODE style abbreviations are allowed: 11 (110), 15 (150), 30 (300), 60 (600), 12 (1200), 24 (2400),
#           48 (4800), 96 (9600), 192 (19200), 384 (38400), 576 (57600), 1152 (115200).
#		Under Linux these higher rates may be recognized: 230400, 460800, 500000, 576000, 921600, 1000000
#		This is version and system dependent. If your serial device driver supports it is still a complete different story.
#	bits: Number of data bits. 8 or 7 (5 or 6 are not supported), default: keep the current setting.
#	parity: Parity.  n (none), o (odd), e (even). If odd or even parity is set the parity is sent, and checked on receiving.
#     When a framing or parity error is detected the character becomes \0. Default: keep the current setting.
#	stopbits: 1 or 2, default: keep the current setting.
#	handshake: Flow control. Default: keep the current setting.
#		none: No flow control
#		rtscts: RTC/CTS hardware handshake, 
#		xonxoff: XOn/XOff software handshake. XOn and XOff characters (021/DC1 and 023/DC3 are not available for data).
#	blocking (see above) is recognized.
#	
#	All the optional parameters can be omitted for virtual serial ports (like USB or Bluetooth) 
#	where they are most likely ignored anyway or may lead to strange results.
#	However upon opening the port will be set to raw mode (Character-wise reading, no processing of data...)
#
# type = TCPClient # TCP/IP client. Actively establishes a connection to a server.  Common parameter 'device' is un-used here.
#	host: (mandatory) Can be numeric or symbolic. IPV4 and IPV6 are supported.
#	port: (mandatory) Numeric or symbolic port numbers (/etc/services) are supported.
#	blocking (see above) is recognized.
# 
# type = UDP # UDP bi-directional connection-less message/datagram oriented connection. In one word: UDP.
#	peerAddress: IP address of the peer computer. Can be numeric or symbolic. IP V4 and V6 are both supported.
#		If omitted you cannot send a message to the peer via the standard interface.
#		However you still can obtain the socket handle, and use [sendto](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendto.2.html) yourself.
#	localAddress: The local address on which the connection will listen to datagrams from the peer.
#		This can be one interface address, or the default local address, or the wildcard address (0.0.0.0, or the IP V6 equivalent).
#		If you omit the parameter, or use the any address the port will receive messages from any host which sends to the specified port.
#	peerPort: Port on which the peer listens. If not specified you cannot send with the class interface.
#		However you still can obtain the socket handle, and use [sendto](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendto.2.html) yourself.
#	localPort: This is the port on which the socket receives datagrams from peer(s).
#		If you do not specify it or set it to 0 a dynamic port number will be assigned when you send data to a peer for the first time.
#		You *must* specify the local port in order to be able to receive data from the peer.
#	blocking (see above) is recognized.
#
# type = I2CMaster # I2C master adapter. Typically used to connect to sensors with short lines and low-mid speed.
#	device: (mandatory) See above.
#	The bus speed can seemingly not be changed by program. You may change it with /sys interface or with the device tree.
#	The i2c-tiny-usb for example seemingly does not provide for a speed adjustment at all.
