/**
 * This namespace includes a complex extended kalman filter (EKF) for implementing a complete electronic compensated variometer, and artificial horizon.
 *
 * Input to this model are inertial measurements from 3-D accelerometer and gyroscopes, a barometric precision altimeter,
 * IAS and TAS measurement from dynamic pressure and GPS coordinates, heading and speed over ground
 *
 * Invaluable inputs for understanding Kalman filters in general, and practical implementation hints came from
 * \sa <a href="http://www.artechhouse.com/static/sample/groves-005_ch03.pdf" >Groves - CHAPTER 3 Kalman Filter-Based Estimation</a>
 *
 * For an EKF I need a Jacobian matrix with the partial derivates at the point of the last status to approximate a linearization of
 * the non-linear function at the latest status. To make my life easier I am using a numeric forward derivation with a small step.
 * For numeric derivation of angles I use an increment of 1 degree. This is small enough for an approximation of sin and cos, and large enough
 * not to create undue numeric issues with scale factors in single precision floats. It has the additional advantage that the increment is
 * 1.0 (degrees), i.e. I am saving myself a division by the increment if it were != 0.
