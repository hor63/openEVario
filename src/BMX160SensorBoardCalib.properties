# Please note! These data here are an example and are for testing.
# They were measured for my first sensor board prototype, and are only valid for this one BMX160 device which was soldered on that board.
# For any other device it is probably better to set bias values to 0, and let the filter determine them, albeit that may take some time,
# and serious thermalling to get the values accurate. Magnetometer bias determination requires GPS for absolute course over ground.

# Calibration data for the BMX160 sensor box
# Except for the accelerometer these are bias and standard deviation values only.

# Magnetometer bias can be measured for the magnetometer 
# measuring the magnetic field in an arbitrary direction as val1,
# turn the box 180 degrees that the measured axis points opposite and measure again as val2.
# The bias is now = (val1 + val2) / 2

# and once straight down for val2. The formula is the same.

# For the accelerometer factor you can get the same measurements val1 and val2 at the same time
# when measuring the bias.
# I only have a calibrated value for the Accelerometer, i.e. the gravity.
# Val1 is the positive gravitation, and val 2 is negative gravity.
# The formula is: 2 / (val1 - val2)
# Please note that the expected value should always be 1.0g
