# Please note! These data here are an example and are for testing.
# They were measured for my first sensor board prototype, and are only valid for this one BMX160 device which was soldered on that board.

# For any other device it is better to set bias values to 0, and let the filter determine them unless you perform the measurements
# described below for your particular device.
# Automatic determination of the biases may take some time, and serious thermalling to get the values accurate.
# Magnetometer bias determination requires GPS for absolute course over ground.
# Please note that in reality the magnetometer bias
# is really the actual sensor bias superimposed with the magnetic deviation at the place where the device is mounted.
# For practical purposes the distinction is moot anyway.

# Calibration data for the BMX160 sensor box
# Except for the accelerometer these are bias and Variance values only.

# Magnetometer bias can be measured for the magnetometer 
# measuring the magnetic field in an arbitrary direction as val1,
# turn the box 180 degrees that the measured axis points opposite and measure again as val2.
# The bias is now = (val1 + val2) / 2
magXBias = -16.6723405
magYBias = -16.3483015
magZBias = 3.722431

# Variance of the magnetometer measurements
magXVariance = 1
magYVariance = 1
magZVariance = 1

# Gyro bias is the easiest: Let the box rest and measure the gyro values. These are the bias.
gyrXBias = -0.157471
gyrYBias = -0.088079
gyrZBias = 0.153319

# Variance of the gyro measurements
gyrXVariance = 0.01
gyrYVariance = 0.01
gyrZVariance = 0.01

# Accel bias is measured mostly the same as magnetometer bias.
# However the measured axis should point straight up for val1,
# and straight down for val2. The formula is the same.
accelXBias = -0.0327955
accelYBias = 0.022569
accelZBias = -0.0007325

# For the accelerometer factor you can get the same measurements val1 and val2 at the same time
# when measuring the bias.
# I actually have a calibrated value for the Accelerometer, i.e. the gravity.
# Val1 is the positive gravitation, and val 2 is negative gravity.
# The formula is: 2 / (val1 - val2)
# Please note that you can use this factor directly to *multiply* your measured value to get the calibrated one.
# Please note that the expected value should always be 1.0g

# Variance of the accelerometer measurements
